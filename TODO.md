Need to add ability to add NOTES for students (ie, using friends number, using parents number)
History section is not yet functional
GROUPS SECTION
Used “groups” instead of “classes” because we do informal education
Online attendance and progress recording is in a phase 2
Attendance sheet - rotate “Progress Notes” to be horizontal
Is there a way to know if they paid or not? Yes, this is coming
Eric does not believe he will import Data from current system.
